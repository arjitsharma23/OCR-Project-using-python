# OCR-Project-using-python
As someone with a passion for leveraging technology and analytics to drive process improvements, I'm thrilled to share a recent project I worked on. Using Python, I developed a backend system to extract and process data from documents, mimicking medical records. By incorporating libraries like pdf2image and pytesseract, I automated the conversion of PDFs into text through OCR, gaining valuable insights into how preprocessing and modular design can enhance efficiency and scalability.

üí° What I Learned:

Efficient text extraction through automation
Improved OCR accuracy with preprocessing
Modular code design for flexibility and scalability
üíº How This Applies to HR: With my background in HR operations, people analytics, and payroll administration across regions like Canada, the US, and Europe, this project opened up exciting opportunities to apply automation in HR processes. From parsing resumes to managing employee lifecycle documents, automating document extraction can significantly streamline operations, reduce errors, and support data-driven decision-making.

‚ö†Ô∏è Unique Challenges in HR:

Handling diverse document formats (resumes, employee records)
Ensuring data security and compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
I‚Äôm always keen to explore how technology can transform HR processes and welcome opportunities for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and growth.
